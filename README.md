GLASS50 - Carlos Gonzalez del Rosal - Chihuahua, Mexico

GLASS50 is a "web" application built with Flask in Python, along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is adapted
to run locally and without interactions with Python and the terminal, using the library Pyfladesk and the tool
Pyinstaller.

The purpose of the application is to substitute a spreadsheet document used to calculate price quotations
for a glass business, managing different sheets, thicknesses and applying details. It allows to calculate
prices, modify them, add them, and delete them using data inside a SQL database (The 4 basic SQL operations).

In order to eliminate all the difficulties provided by the spreadsheet software for a person not adapted to
technology, this application has a very limited selection of buttons, all the select items are dynamically
generated HTML with only the available options according to the previous values selected, and all input boxes are
restricted, case for text and maximums, minimums and steps for numbers.
